# Stigmee: The art to sanctuarize knowledge exchanges

To compile Stigmee, for Linux and MacOS X but not for Windows, either in debug mode:

```bash
./build.sh debug
```

Or release mode:

```bash
./build.sh release
```

Once done, Stigmee binary is present in the `build/` folder (for example for Linux `build/Stigmee.x11.debug.64`).

**Note:** This command will also install localy a Godot editor version 3.4.2-stable. Used it to develop the Stigmee
application and to export (aka compiling) Stigmee binaries.
